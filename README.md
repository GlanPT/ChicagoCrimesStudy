# 🕵️‍♂️Chicago Crimes Machine Learning Project

## 🔍 Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze the Chicago Crimes dataset. The dataset contains information about various crimes reported in the city of Chicago, including details such as location, type of crime, date, and time. By applying machine learning algorithms to this dataset, we aim to gain insights into crime patterns, predict future occurrences.

## 📔Dataset
The Chicago Crimes dataset used in this project is publicly available and can be accessed from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2). It includes millions of records spanning several years, making it suitable for extensive analysis and modeling.
In this project was used a version from the year 2007.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform exploratory analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify trends, and visualize patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Preprocess the data, extract relevant features, and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Development**: Train machine learning models to predict various aspects of crime, such as crime type, location, and time.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and validate their effectiveness.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained models for real-world applications, such as crime prediction and resource allocation.

## 👨‍💻Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **R**: To make the rules and graphs.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and evaluating predictive models.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code development, analysis, and visualization.
